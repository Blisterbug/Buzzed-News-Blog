# Note From Developer 

This project supports dynamic fetching using any news API . Since the project is at developing stage i personally use News API for development purpose . Since News API doesn't support CORS enabled on all origins . "I was cornered to Hard Code the News Cards values". So if you need to fetch data dynamically from API . Clone our Github Repository, Run the project locally and in buzzed-news-blog/src/cards/ExampleCard . Please Refer the card for dynamic fetching.
